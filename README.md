Here we can discuss and try new code. I really recommend you to read GitHub's basics on: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Please, do not work on the master branch (unless for the data upload), start a new one instead :)

Issues: we can talk about problems or doubts.

Pull request: when somebody want they part to be added to the master branch.

Projects: I have created the man project. The every note can be converted into a new "project".

Wiki: information and papers.

Insights: if you want to know who has been working on what.
